# Logd
![A circular buffer](.doc/circular_buffer.svg)

## Hundreds of millions of logs for your apps in constant time and constant space.
Logd (pronounced "logged") is a circular buffer for writing & reading millions of logs per second.

Logd will never run out of memory if the buffer size is ok for the given machine spec. Reads & writes are constant-time.

As the buffer becomes full, each write overwrites the oldest element.

# TODO

## Fix Replay Vulnerability
There is currently no cache of UDP packet hashes, so we can't yet detect/prevent a replay.
A ring buffer would probably be ideal for this.

Estimated time start-to-prod: 2-3 hours.


# Auth
Logd authenticates clients for either reading or writing using 2 shared secrets.
These are stored encrypted in our secrets SOPS file.

## Why no SSO?
Writing is over UDP only, anyway. This will not change.
This is an important design choice that ensures performance, but also separation of concerns.

If you want to put the HTTP API behind SSO, just write a proxy. ;)

This is a simple, performant & usable application that you can, and should, build on.

# HTTP API
Logd starts a http server.
## GET /
```bash
curl --location "$LOGD_HOST/?limit=10" \
--header "Authorization: $LOGD_READ_SECRET"
```
## GET /info

# Logging (writing logs)
## I'd tell you a joke about UDP, but you might not get it...
Logd is built on Protobuf & UDP.

## Logger
The simplest way to write logs is using the `log` package.
```go
l, _ := log.NewLogger(&log.LoggerConfig{
  Host:        "logd.fly.dev",
  WriteSecret: "the-secret",
  Env:         "prod",
  Svc:         "example-service",
  Fn:          "Readme",
})
l.Log(log.Info, "this is an example %s", "log message")
```

## Custom integration
Logs are written by connecting to a UDP socket on port `:6102`.
See the following example. Error checks skipped for brevity.
```go
// dial udp
addr, _ := conn.GetAddr("logd.fly.dev")
socket, _ := conn.Dial(addr)

// serialise message using protobuf
payload, err := proto.Marshal(&cmd.Cmd{
		Name: cmd.Name_WRITE,
		Msg: &cmd.Msg{
			T:          timestamppb.Now(),
			Env:        env,
			Svc:        cwmsg.Svc,
			Fn:         cwmsg.Fn,
			Lvl:        &lvl,
			Txt:        &cwmsg.Msg,
			StackTrace: st,
		},
	})

// get ephemeral signature using current time
signedMsg, _ := auth.Sign("some-secret-value", payload, time.Now())

// write to socket
socket.Write(signedMsg)
```

# Protobuf
Logd is built on protobuf.
```bash
protoc --go_out=. cmd.proto # generate source files
```
